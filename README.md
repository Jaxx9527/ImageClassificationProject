# ImageClassificationProject
ResNet50和ViT結合模型實現影像分類   

## 題目要求
In this project, you are required to do a classification task on 6 types of objects related to Guangzhou International Campus, SCUT.

Use all the methods and tricks, including you learned in the lectures or from other resources, to train your own model with your own dataset.   

1. You should create your own dataset based on the examples. The examples of the test set are released and you should create your own dataset referring to the examples by taking photos or collecting images from the Internet. Do not use the released examples in the training!  
2. You should submit your model and test file to TA then obtain a test result. The test set will be kept by the TA in order to avoid possible cheating by directly training the model on the test set. You should submit a test  script with your model to TA then the TA cantest your result. The template of the test script is released with the data examples and you have 3 chances to submit the model. The data in the test set will be similar to the given examples and please validate your test script on the examples first.  
3. A project report within 5 pages and an oral presentation with slides should be completed.
